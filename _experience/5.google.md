I am beyond thrilled and humbled to share that I will be joining Matthias Grundmann and Tingbo Hou's team in Google AI as a full-time Research Engineer. I will focus on applied research of on-device applications, deep generative models, and real-time animations in Google products, Mediapipe.

Appreciate all my peers, friends, family who had been supporting me during the job-hunting process. Only with your encouragement and inspiration all along the way could I overcome the hardest time in my life over the past 5 months and 9 interviews.

Truly a long dream in my heart comes true. Filled with immense gratitude, I cannot wait to meet the whole team in Google Mountain View B43 where I will be based in!

As Marianne Williamson Quotes: The top of one mountain is always the bottom of another. Keep moving to my next milestone!
