I was master student majoring in comptuer science from 2020 to 2022 at New York University MSCS. I registered courses mainly focusing on machine learning, related techniques, including machine perceptron, computer vision, deep learning and computer graphics. I worked with Prof. Daniele in the field of geometry modeling and broad phase collision detection.
