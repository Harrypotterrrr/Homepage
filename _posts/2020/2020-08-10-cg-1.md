An Overview to Computer Graphics

<!--more-->

## Computer Graphics

To synthesis and manipulate visual information.

### Application

- **Video Games**: Technically, global illumination determines the quality of the game performance: the lighter the graphics shows, the better the game is.
- **Movies**: Special effects
- **Animations**: Simulate particles in different scenes.
- Design
- **Visualization**: One of the way to manipulate visual information.
- **Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality**
- **Digital Illustration**.
- **Simulation**: physical simulation, computation and implementation.
- **Graphical User Interface**
- **Topography**

### Fundamental Challenge

- Require understanding of all aspects of physical world
- Create and interact with realistic virtual world
- Computing methods, displays, technology.


## Topics
  
### Rasterization

- Project `geometry primitives` (3D triangles/polygons) on to the screen.
- Break projected primitives into `fragments` (pixels)
- Gold standard in Video Games (Real-time Applications)

**Real-time/offline computer graphics**: more than 30 fps (frame per second)

### Curves and Meshes

How to represent geometry in Computer Graphics

- Bezier Curve
- Catmull-Clark subdivision

### Ray Tracing

- Shoot rays from the camera through each pixel
- Gold standard in Animations / Movies (Offline Application)\


### Animation / Simulation

- Key frame animation
- Mass-spring System

## CG vs CV

### Difference

![cg-1-1](https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/29/r7onmT.jpg)

- Computer Vision is to understand, recognize and predict the content of images.

- Computer Graphics is to model and simulate the geometry of visual information.
