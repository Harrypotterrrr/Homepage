Google AI ML Winter Camp

Google headquarters, Beijing, China

• To automatically analyze the structure of a relatively long article: it takes in the raw article and split it into reasonable sections.

• To use BERT as an encoder to encode paragraphs.

• To tag each paragraph according to its position within the section it belongs to and the relation between it with the neighbor above.

Haolin Jia – Curriculum Vitæ  – March, 2019


# Research Interests

Skyscraping passion for Deep learning, Machine learning, Computer vision, Big data visualization ands Natural language processing.


# Current Effort

1.	Auto poster generator

It aims to generate a poster by using a sequence model composed of generator model of LSTM and independent discriminator of naive CNN to extract feature and evaluate.

To train the GAN model with a few samples and decoration arrangement is the current problem.

2.	Gray image colorization

With innovative framework, this project is my national science and technology innovation project. We are proposing a new model that may show the best performance across different life scenes.
