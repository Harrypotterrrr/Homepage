## Biography 

I have just been accepted as a MSCS student of NYU. I am going to work with [Daniele Panozzo](https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/daniele.html) and focus on computer graphics. I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Tongji University, China, in 2016 and had been a research intern in [Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab](https://idvxlab.com/index.html) supervised by [Prof. Nan Cao](http://nancao.org/). In the last year of my undergraduate period, I did research in the field of computer vision under the supervision of [Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/) and his [Ph.D. Taihong Xiao](https://prinsphield.github.io/) in University of California at Merced.
