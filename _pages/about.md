## Biography 

I am a junior majoring computer science from Tongji University. I am now working as an internship in [Intelligent Big Data Visualization Lab](https://idvxlab.com/index.html) supervised by [Prof. Nan Cao](http://nancao.org/), and currently focusing on the sequence module transforming text descriptions to images or scenes. I am going to visit [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/), at Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Merced, under the supervision of [Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/) and his [Ph.D. Yijun Li](https://sites.google.com/site/yijunlimaverick/). We will do some research in the field of image/video generation and synthesis.
